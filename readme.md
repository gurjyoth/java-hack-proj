Bug Tracker Console Application 🐞

This document provides instructions on the project's file structure and how to compile and run the application using Apache Maven.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Maven directory layout. Once you create the project and add the Java files, the structure will look like this:

bug-tracker-console/
│
├── .mvn/                  <-- Maven wrapper files (optional)

├── src/

│   ├── main/

│   │   └── java/

│   │       └── com/

│   │           └── bugtracker/

│   │               ├── main/         (Contains the application entry point)

│   │               │   └── Main.java

│   │               ├── model/        (Contains data objects and enums)

│   │               │   ├── Bug.java

│   │               │   ├── User.java

│   │               │   └── enums/

│   │               ├── service/      (Contains business logic and data handling)

│   │               │   ├── BugReportingSystem.java

│   │               │   └── DataStore.java

│   └── test/                 <-- Directory for unit tests

│

├── target/                <-- Directory for compiled code and packaged JAR (created by Maven)

│

├── pom.xml                <-- The main Maven configuration file

│

├── bugs.json              <-- Database file for bugs (created on first run)

└── users.json             <-- Database file for users (created on first run)


src/main/java: This is where all the application's source code (.java files) resides.

pom.xml: This is the core configuration file for Maven. It lists project dependencies (like Gson), build instructions, and project metadata.

target/: When you build the project, Maven places the compiled code and the final executable .jar file in this directory. You can safely delete this folder; Maven will recreate it.

bugs.json / users.json: These files are generated by the application itself when it runs for the first time. They act as a simple database, storing all your data in JSON format.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following software installed on your system:

Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 11 or newer.

Apache Maven.

## How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to compile and run the bug tracker from your terminal.

Open a Terminal: Open your command prompt, PowerShell, or terminal.

Navigate to Project Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the root folder of the project (the bug-tracker-console directory where the pom.xml file is located).

Bash

cd path/to/bug-tracker-console
Compile and Run: You can run the application in two ways.

Option A: Run Directly with Maven (Easiest for development)
This command compiles the code and runs the application without creating a JAR file.

Bash

mvn exec:java
Option B: Package into a Runnable JAR (Best for distribution)
This creates a single, self-contained .jar file in the target/ directory that you can run anywhere.

First, package the application:

Bash

mvn package
Then, run the generated JAR file:

Bash

java -jar target/bug-tracker-console-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
## Default User Credentials
Once the application is running, you can log in with these default users:

Reporter:

Username: reporter1

Password: pass

Developer:

Username: dev1

Password: pass

Developer:

Username: dev2

Password: pass
